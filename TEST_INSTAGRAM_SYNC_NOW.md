# Test Instagram Sync - Simple Steps

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

1. **Added Workspace Wait Logic** - Frontend now waits for workspace to load before syncing
2. **Updated Refresh Button** - Uses new immediate sync endpoint
3. **Triple Refetch System** - Refetches at 0s, 2s, and 5s after sync

## 🧪 TEST METHOD 1: Use Refresh Button (EASIEST!)

1. Go to **Integration** page (`/integration`)
2. Find your Instagram account card
3. Click the **"Refresh"** button
4. **Watch both consoles**:
   - **Browser Console (F12)**: You should see:
     ```
     🔄 Manual refresh triggered for workspace: [id]
     ✅ Manual refresh completed: { success: true, username: 'rahulc1020' }
     ✅ Refresh mutation success, refetching data...
     ```
   - **Server Console**: You should see:
     ```
     [IMMEDIATE SYNC] 🚀 Force sync requested for workspace: [id]
     [IMMEDIATE SYNC] Found account: { username: 'rahulc1020', hasToken: true }
     [INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC] 🚀 Starting immediate sync for account: [id]
     [INSTAGRAM DIRECT] Real Instagram Business profile: { followers_count: 3, media_count: 15 }
     [INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC] ✅ Profile data fetched
     [INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC] ✅ Engagement metrics calculated
     [INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC] ✅ Account data updated successfully
     [IMMEDIATE SYNC] ✅ Sync completed successfully
     ```
5. **Wait 3-5 seconds** - Data should update!

## 🧪 TEST METHOD 2: Reconnect Instagram

1. **Disconnect** Instagram account
2. **Reconnect** Instagram account  
3. After OAuth redirect, **watch browser console**:
   ```
   OAuth callback success detected, refreshing data...
   ⏳ Waiting for workspace to load... (attempt 1/10)
   ✅ Workspace loaded: [id]
   🚀 Calling immediate sync API for workspace: [id]
   ✅ Immediate sync API succeeded: { success: true, username: 'rahulc1020' }
   ```
4. **Wait 5 seconds** - Data should appear!

## 📊 What Should Happen

### Before:
- ❌ Followers: 0
- ❌ Engagement: 0.0%

### After (within 3-5 seconds):
- ✅ Followers: 3 (or your real count)
- ✅ Engagement: 4-5% (calculated)
- ✅ Profile picture visible
- ✅ Last sync time updated

## 🐛 If It Doesn't Work

### Check Browser Console (F12):
1. Is `🔄 Manual refresh triggered` showing?
   - **NO**: Button not working, check currentWorkspace
   - **YES**: Continue to next step

2. Is `✅ Manual refresh completed` showing?
   - **NO**: API call failed, check server logs
   - **YES**: Continue to next step

3. Is `✅ Refresh mutation success` showing?
   - **NO**: Response was null/error
   - **YES**: Continue to next step

### Check Server Console:
1. Is `[IMMEDIATE SYNC] 🚀 Force sync requested` showing?
   - **NO**: API endpoint not being hit
   - **YES**: Continue to next step

2. Is `[IMMEDIATE SYNC] Found account` showing?
   - **NO**: Account not in database or wrong workspace
   - **YES**: Continue to next step

3. Is `[INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC] ✅ Account data updated successfully` showing?
   - **NO**: Sync failed, check error messages
   - **YES**: Data was updated! Wait for frontend refetch

## 🚀 Quick Test Command

Open browser console on Integration page and run:

```javascript
// Test the sync API directly
fetch('/api/instagram/immediate-sync', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    workspaceId: document.querySelector('[data-workspace-id]')?.dataset.workspaceId || 'YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE'
  })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

1. **Browser Console**: No errors, sees workspace ID, calls API
2. **Server Console**: Shows `[IMMEDIATE SYNC]` and `[INSTAGRAM DIRECT SYNC]` logs
3. **UI**: Numbers update from 0 to real values within 5 seconds
4. **Success Modal**: Shows "Data Synced!" message

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always check BOTH consoles** - Browser and Server
2. **Refresh button is fastest** - Use it for quick testing
3. **Wait 5 full seconds** - Data updates in waves (0s, 2s, 5s)
4. **Check Last Sync time** - Should update when sync completes
