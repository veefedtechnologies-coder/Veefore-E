# ⚠️ **YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER!**

## 🔍 **Why Shares/Saves is Still 0**

Your logs show:
```
[SMART POLLING] 💾 Updating database with shares: 0, saves: 0
```

But they're **MISSING** the new debugging logs I added:
```
❌ MISSING: [SMART POLLING] 🔍 Saves API response status for post X
❌ MISSING: [SMART POLLING] 🔍 Saves raw data for post X
❌ MISSING: [SMART POLLING] 📊 Saves summary
```

**This means your server is running OLD CODE!** The changes haven't been applied yet.

## 🚀 **RESTART THE SERVER NOW**

### Kill All Node Processes:
```bash
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Wait 2 Seconds:
```bash
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
```

### Start Fresh Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✅ **After Restart, You Should See:**

### When Smart Polling Runs (~3 minutes):
```
[SMART POLLING] 🔍 Saves API response status for post 18053962234971510: 200
[SMART POLLING] 🔍 Saves raw data for post 18053962234971510: {"data":[...]}
[SMART POLLING] ✅ Real saves for post 18053962234971510: 5
[SMART POLLING] 📊 Saves summary: 15 saves from 3 posts
```

## 🎯 **What Changes Need to Be Applied:**

1. ✅ Smart Sync button fix (RealtimeService import)
2. ✅ Module import fix (mongodb-storage)
3. ✅ Saves metric name fix (`saves` → `saved`)
4. ✅ Enhanced saves debugging logs

**All these changes are in the code, but your server needs to restart!**

---

## 📝 **Steps:**

1. **Stop server** (Ctrl+C or kill processes)
2. **Wait 2 seconds**
3. **Run `npm run dev`**
4. **Wait 3 minutes** for smart polling cycle
5. **Check logs** - you'll see the new debugging

**RESTART NOW - The code is fixed, but the old server is still running!** 🔄
