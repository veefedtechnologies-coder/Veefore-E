VEEFORE – CREDIT SYSTEM & INFRASTRUCTURE COST LOGIC
This document defines how Veefore’s credit system works, why it exists, and how it protects
infrastructure costs while supporting growth and upgrades. This is a foundational system —
weakening it will directly harm margins and stability.
--------------------------------------------------
1. WHY A CREDIT SYSTEM IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
Veefore runs AI-powered actions that consume:
- LLM tokens
- API calls
- Compute time
- Queue processing
Without a credit system:
- Costs scale faster than revenue
- Abuse becomes unavoidable
- Pricing loses meaning
Credits are not a UX feature. They are a survival mechanism.
--------------------------------------------------
2. CORE CREDIT PHILOSOPHY
Credits are designed to:
- Control AI usage fairly
- Encourage thoughtful automation
- Create natural upgrade pressure
- Keep infrastructure predictable
Credits are NOT meant to:
- Punish users
- Confuse users
- Hide value
Simplicity beats cleverness at this stage.
--------------------------------------------------
3. CREDIT UNIT DEFINITION
1 Credit = 1 AI Action
AI Actions include:
- Generating 1 hook
- Generating 1 caption
- Replying to 1 comment
- Replying to 1 DM
- Scanning 1 competitor content batch
All actions cost the same initially to avoid complexity.
--------------------------------------------------
4. CREDIT ALLOCATION BY PLAN
STARTER – ■399 / month
- 300 credits / month
- Designed for ideation, not automation
- Users hit limits quickly by design
GROWTH – ■899 / month
- 1,200 credits / month
- Supports real engagement automation
- Balanced for ROI without abuse
PRO / AGENCY – ■1999 / month
- 3,000 credits / month
- Supports multi-account scale
- Highest throughput and priority
FREE TRIAL
- 150 credits total
- 7-day expiry
- Automation volume capped
--------------------------------------------------
5. CREDIT ADD-ON STRATEGY
Optional add-ons:
- +200 credits → ■199
- +500 credits → ■399
- +1,000 credits → ■699
Credits never feel unlimited.
Add-ons protect margins and unlock revenue flexibility.
--------------------------------------------------
6. CREDIT RESET & ROLLOVER RULES
- Credits reset monthly
- No rollover in early stage
- No manual credit grants
Rollover can be introduced later for retention — not now.
--------------------------------------------------
7. INFRASTRUCTURE COST CONTROL
Credit caps ensure:
- Predictable LLM spend
- Stable queue lengths
- Fair usage distribution
- Abuse prevention
Every AI feature must be wired to the credit ledger.
--------------------------------------------------
8. USER COMMUNICATION STRATEGY
Do NOT say:
“You ran out of credits.”
Say:
“Your growth capacity for this month is reached.”
Language reinforces value, not limitation.
--------------------------------------------------
9. COMMON CREDIT SYSTEM MISTAKES
- Unlimited AI promises
- Hidden credit drains
- Overly complex weights
- Emotional manual overrides
Discipline here decides survival.
--------------------------------------------------
10. FINAL SUMMARY
The credit system is the economic engine of Veefore.
If this system stays intact:
- Costs stay controlled
- Users upgrade naturally
- The product scales safely
If this system is weakened:
- Margins collapse
- Abuse rises
- Sustainability is lost
Treat this document as immutable during early growth.
