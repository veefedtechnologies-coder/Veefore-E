VEEFORE – FREE TRIAL STRATEGY DOCUMENT
This document defines Veefore’s free trial system. The free trial is not a giveaway. It is a controlled
conversion engine designed to demonstrate value, introduce friction, and drive upgrades without
damaging pricing integrity or infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE OF THE FREE TRIAL
The free trial exists to:
- Prove Veefore’s core value quickly
- Let users experience real automation
- Create urgency and decision pressure
- Convert serious users into paying customers
The free trial is NOT meant to:
- Replace a paid plan
- Offer unlimited access
- Please everyone
--------------------------------------------------
2. TRIAL MODEL OVERVIEW
Veefore uses a:
7-Day Free Trial on the Growth Plan (Limited)
Why this works:

- Basic DM keyword replies
- Growth-aware Scheduler (7–10 posts)
