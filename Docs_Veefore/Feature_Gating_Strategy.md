VEEFORE – FEATURE GATING STRATEGY DOCUMENT
This document defines how features are distributed across plans in Veefore and why each gate
exists. Feature gating is not about restriction — it is about protecting value, encouraging upgrades,
and keeping the product sustainable.
--------------------------------------------------
1. WHY FEATURE GATING IS CRITICAL
Without strong gating:
- Users never upgrade
- Infrastructure costs explode
- Power features get abused
- Product positioning weakens
Feature gating ensures that Veefore attracts serious creators and rewards commitment.
--------------------------------------------------
2. CORE GATING PRINCIPLES
Veefore follows these rules:
- Growth-driving automation is never free
- Entry plans educate, not scale
- Core USP lives in the Growth plan
- Pro plan exists to anchor value and scale usage
If a feature directly increases engagement or saves major time, it must be gated.
--------------------------------------------------
3. STARTER PLAN FEATURE ACCESS (■399)
Purpose:
Allow users to improve content quality and consistency, but clearly feel growth limits.
Unlocked:
- AI Hook Generator (limited)
- AI Caption & CTA Engine
- Growth-aware Scheduler (limited posts)
- Basic competitor insight (1 competitor)
- Performance summary (read-only)
Locked:
- AI Comment Automation
- AI DM Automation
- Adaptive AI learning loop
- Multi-account support
- Engagement analytics depth
Why this works:
Users feel smarter but not faster. Growth ceiling is intentional.
--------------------------------------------------
4. GROWTH PLAN FEATURE ACCESS (■899)
Purpose:
Deliver real ROI and automation.
Unlocked:
- AI Comment Automation (primary USP)
- Smart DM keyword replies
- AI Hook & Trend Intelligence
- AI Caption & CTA Engine (full)
- Growth-aware Scheduler (unlimited)
- Competitor intelligence (up to 3 competitors)
- Adaptive AI learning loop
- Engagement analytics
Locked:
- Advanced DM funnels
- Team access
- Priority processing
Why this works:
This plan feels complete and powerful without giving away scale features.
--------------------------------------------------
5. PRO / AGENCY PLAN FEATURE ACCESS (■1999)
Purpose:
Enable scale and justify premium pricing.
Unlocked:
- Everything in Growth
- Manage 3–5 social accounts
- Advanced DM funnels & follow-ups
- Team access (2–5 users)
- Priority AI processing
- Highest credit limits
- Advanced reports (future)
Why this works:
Pro users operate differently. They value speed, volume, and control.
--------------------------------------------------
6. GATING AUTOMATION & AI FEATURES
Automation rules:
- No automation in Starter
- Limited automation in Trial
- Full automation only in Growth and Pro
This protects:
- Platform safety
- AI cost
- Product seriousness
--------------------------------------------------
7. COMMON GATING MISTAKES TO AVOID
- Giving automation in Starter
- Unlocking everything in trial
- Weakening gates due to user complaints
- Competing with cheaper tools
Strong gates attract strong users.
--------------------------------------------------
8. HOW GATING SUPPORTS PRICING & CONVERSION
Starter creates desire.
Growth delivers results.
Pro anchors value.
This creates a clean, predictable upgrade path.
--------------------------------------------------
9. FINAL SUMMARY
Feature gating is a strategic weapon, not a UX obstacle.
Veefore’s gating ensures:
- sustainable growth
- clear differentiation
