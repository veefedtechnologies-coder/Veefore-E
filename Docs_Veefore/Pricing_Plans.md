VEEFORE – PRICING & PLANS STRATEGY DOCUMENT
This document defines how Veefore makes money without killing growth, burning AI costs, or
attracting low-quality users. Pricing is positioning. This strategy is designed to attract serious
creators, drive upgrades, and protect margins.
--------------------------------------------------
1. WHY PRICING MATTERS FOR VEEFORE
Veefore is not a commodity tool. It is an AI growth engine that automates engagement and visibility.
If priced incorrectly, Veefore risks becoming:
- a cheap AI toy
- a high-churn product
- an infra-cost nightmare
The goal of pricing is not maximum signups. The goal is maximum long-term value.
--------------------------------------------------
2. CORE PRICING PHILOSOPHY
Veefore does not sell features.
Veefore sells:
- saved time
- increased engagement
- faster growth
- automation leverage
Pricing is based on usage intensity and growth speed, not feature count.
--------------------------------------------------
3. PLAN STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
Veefore uses a three-tier pricing model:
1. Starter – Testing growth
2. Growth – Scaling engagement (core plan)
3. Pro / Agency – Operating at scale
This structure creates a natural upgrade path.

The trial must never remove friction completely.
--------------------------------------------------
8. PRICING DO’S AND DON’TS
Do:
- Highlight Growth plan as default

Do Not:
- Compete on cheap pricing

- Discount heavily
--------------------------------------------------
9. LONG-TERM PRICING EVOLUTION
Future expansion options:

But only after strong core traction.

10. FINAL PRICING SUMMARY
Veefore pricing works because it:
- aligns with real value

This document should be treated as a fixed reference during early growth. Changing pricing
impulsively is one of the fastest ways to kill a SaaS.
