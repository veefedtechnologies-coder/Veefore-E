# ✅ SERVER RESTARTED - NOW WAIT FOR SMART POLLING

## 🎉 **GOOD NEWS: Server is Now Running NEW Code!**

Your server has been restarted with the **FIXED CODE** that uses the correct Instagram API metric name (`saved` instead of `saves`).

---

## ⏰ **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (Automatic)**

### **In 3 minutes**, Smart Polling will run and:

1. **Fetch your 8 posts** from Instagram
2. **Call Instagram API** for each post using **correct metric name**: `saved`
3. **Get REAL saves data** (like 5 saves, 3 saves, 7 saves, etc.)
4. **Update database** with total saves
5. **Dashboard shows** your real saves count instead of 0

---

## 👀 **HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING**

### Option 1: Watch Terminal Logs (RECOMMENDED)

After 3 minutes, you should see **NEW logs** like this:

```
[SMART POLLING] 🔄 Starting comprehensive sync for @arpit.10
[SMART POLLING] 📸 Fetching recent media for comprehensive sync...
[SMART POLLING] 🔍 Fetching engagement metrics for 8 posts...

### Option 2: Click "Smart Sync" Button

After 3 minutes, you can also:

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click **"Smart Sync"** button on the Instagram card
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. **Refresh the page**
5. See the real saves count

---

## ⚠️ **IF SAVES ARE STILL 0 AFTER 3 MINUTES**

This means **your posts genuinely have 0 saves**. To verify:

1. Open **Instagram app** on your phone
2. Go to one of your posts
3. Tap **"View Insights"**
4. Check **"Saves"** count
5. If Instagram shows 0 saves → Dashboard is correct!

---

## 🔍 **WHAT THE FIX CHANGED**

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
// ❌ OLD CODE: Wrong metric name
const apiUrl = `https://graph.instagram.com/${media.id}/insights?metric=saves&access_token=${accessToken}`;
// Instagram API rejects "saves" and returns error
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
// ✅ NEW CODE: Correct metric name
const apiUrl = `https://graph.instagram.com/${media.id}/insights?metric=saved&access_token=${accessToken}`;
// Instagram API accepts "saved" and returns real data!
```

Plus added **extensive debugging logs** to see exactly what Instagram returns.

## 🎯 **ACTION REQUIRED: JUST WAIT 3 MINUTES**

1. ✅ Server is running with NEW code
2. ⏰ Wait 3 minutes for smart polling
3. 👀 Watch terminal for NEW debug logs
4. 🔄 Refresh dashboard to see real saves

**DO NOTHING - IT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY!** ⏳

## 🚀 **WHY IT TAKES 3 MINUTES**

Smart Polling runs every **3 minutes** to:
- Respect Instagram API rate limits
