# 🚀 Manual Server Start Guide

## ✅ **Port 5000 is Now Clear!**

All Node processes have been killed and port 5000 is available.

---

## 📝 **How to Start Your Server Manually**

### Option 1: Using PowerShell/CMD
1. Open a new terminal window
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```bash
   cd "E:\Veefed Veefore\Veefore"
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Using the Batch File
Double-click `start-server.bat` in your project folder

## 🎯 **What to Watch For**

Once the server starts, you should see:

```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Server successfully bound to port 5000
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 📊 **After Server Starts**

1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Login to your dashboard**
3. **Check the metrics** - you should see:
   - ✅ **453 followers** (not 0!)
   - ✅ **8 posts**
   - ✅ **BUSINESS account type**
   - ✅ Real engagement data

## 🔍 **Recent Fixes Applied**

✅ **Frontend data fetching** - `refetchOnMount: 'always'`, `staleTime: 0`  
✅ **OAuth callback refresh** - Invalidates and refetches all data  
✅ **Encrypted token handling** - Properly decrypts access tokens  
✅ **MongoDB ObjectId error** - Fixed invalid regex on `_id` field  

---

## 🐛 **What Was Fixed**

Your logs show the backend **IS working perfectly**:
```
followersCount: 453 ✅
mediaCount: 8 ✅
accountType: BUSINESS ✅
totalLikes: 508 ✅
totalComments: 71 ✅
totalReach: 6096 ✅
engagementRate: 10% ✅
```

**The data is in your database!** You just need to start the server to see it on the dashboard.

---

## ⚠️ **Redis Errors (Ignore These)**

You'll see lots of Redis connection errors:
```
❌ Redis: Connection failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
```

**This is NORMAL and doesn't affect functionality!** Your app falls back to the MongoDB-based system, which works perfectly.

---

## 🚀 **Ready to Start!**

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
cd "E:\Veefed Veefore\Veefore"
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

Your **453 followers** should be visible! 🎉
